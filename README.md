# AcroIQ Drivers

Open Hardware LED drivers based on various controller ICs. The origin software for these drivers is Altium - as such, its not particularly useful for most users to include the exact source files. Schematics, Gerbers, and Drill files are available for most designs.

Please see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for usage restrictions based on the CERN Open Hardware License.

## Drivers

* [Basic4](basic4/) - A 4 channel design based on the RichTek RT8741 controller, for up to 1A, in a tiny 1.7x2.2 inch form factor. Optional integrated controller based on a PIC16F to provide local PWM control from analog inputs or as an I2C slave device.

## Boards

Blank boards can be readily ordered from OSHPark or other PCB suppliers. Components can be ordered from DigiKey or other distributors. Assembly is up to you :)

Assembled drivers may be available from [blueAcro.com](https://blueacro.com/)
